## Description

MyRestaurants is an Android application where users can search for restaurants, by zipcode, through the Yelp API. Users can click on restaurants that show on the list and see more details. The User can click on the Yelp link and go to the Yelp app or Yelp.com in their browser. The User can click on the phone and call the number listed. The User can click the address and look it up in a Map app.
The User can click 'Save Restaurant' and it will appear on their My Saved Restaurants list. In My Saved Restaurants, the User can change the order of the restaurants listed and delete restaurants from their saved list.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
You will need the following programs installed on your computer.
* Android Studio
* Java JDK 8+
* Android SDK

### To Run LogLegal
* In a terminal window, navigate to ~/AndroidStudioProjects
* Run `git clone https://github.com/midoribowen/LogLegal.git`
* Navigate to ~/AndroidStudioProjects/LogLegal
* Run on either an emulator or an Android OS Device connected to a computer

##### To set up an emulator
* Select Run > Run 'app'
* Click 'Create New Emulator'
* Select the device you would like to emulate (Recommended: Nexus 6)
* Select the API level you would like to run - click 'Download' if not available (Recommended: Marshmallow - ABI: x86)
* Select configuration settings for emulator
 * Recommended:
 * Scale: 4dp on device = 1px on screen
 * Camera - Front: Webcam()
 * Camera - Back: Webcam()
* Click 'Finish' and allow Emulator to run

##### To Run on an Android OS Device
* Connect the device to the computer through its USB port
* Make sure USB debugging is enabled (this may pop up in a window when you connect the device or it may need to be checked in the phone's settings)
* Select Run > Run 'app'
* Select the device (If it does not show, USB debugging is probably not enabled)
* Click 'OK'

###### HAXM Errors

If you receive an error about HAX or HAXM, you may not have HAXM installed or HAXM may be installed improperly.

Open Android Studio > Preferences and navigate to the SDK Manager through the Preferences menu (Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK).

 Then click the link for 'Launch Standalone SDK Manager'. Scroll to the last item in this list to 'Intel X86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)'. If this says 'Installed', the problem is probably this: [How to Fix: "HAX is not working and emulator runs in emulation mode"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21031903/how-to-fix-hax-is-not-working-and-emulator-runs-in-emulation-mode).

 Select the checkbox next to this package and click 'Delete 1 package'. After it is deleted, try to reinstall with 1536MB of RAM allowed by HAXM, by following the instructions in the link below.

 If it is not installed, follow the instructions here: [Installation Instructions for IntelÂ® Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager - Mac OS X*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/installation-instructions-for-intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-mac-os-x). Make sure to allow at least 1536MB of RAM.
